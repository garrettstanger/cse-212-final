# Python Data Structures Tutorial
## Topics


Welcome to a basic data structure tutorial for the python programming language. We will be covering these three basic topics:

- [Queues](1-queue.md)
- [Sets](2-set.md)
- [Trees](3-tree.md)

Each of the topics will include a description with some practical examples of how data structures can be implemented. There will also be a problem for you to solve with one of the possible solutions that you can compare your code with.
